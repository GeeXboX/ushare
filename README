GeeXboX uShare - Introduction
=============================

GeeXboX uShare is a UPnP (TM) A/V Media Server. It implements the server
component that provides UPnP media devices with information on available
multimedia files. uShare uses the built-in http server of libupnp to
stream the files to clients.

GeeXboX uShare is a fork from the GMediaServer (UPnP AV Audio Media Server)
from Oskar Liljeblad. It has been stripped down for GeeXboX purpose in
order to be a lighweight multimedia media server.

By opposition to GMediaServer, it does _NOT_ grab any information from
audio files (like ID3 tags) but is _NOT_ limited to audio files.
GeeXboX uShare is able to provide access to both images, videos, music
or playlists files (see below for a complete file format support list).
It does not act as an UPnP Media Adaptor and thus, can't transcode
streams to fit the client requirements.

uShare is written in C by Benjamin Zores for the GeeXboX project (see
http://www.geexbox.org/). It is designed to provide access to multimedia
contents to GeeXboX but can of course be used by any other UPnP client device.
It should compile and run on any modern POSIX compatible system such as Linux.

GeeXboX uShare is free software - it is licensed under the terms of the GNU

Homepage
========

Web site and file area for uShare is hosted on GeeXboX server :

   http://ushare.geexbox.org/

The latest version of uShare should always be available on this site.

Requirements
============

The following programs are required to build uShare:

 * GNU C Compiler (gcc), 2.95 or later.

   The GNU C Compiler is part of the GNU Compiler Collection which can be
   downloaded from http://gcc.gnu.org/.

The following UPnP library is required to build and run uShare :

 * Linux SDK for UPnP Devices (libupnp), 1.2.1 or later

   The libupnp library is used to communicate using the UPnP protocol.
   libupnp can be downloaded from http://upnp.sourceforge.net/.

Building and Installation
=========================

Compile uShare by running configure and then make. This should
produce an executable ushare in the src subdirectory, which can be
used right away. No extra files need to be installed.

You can pass the CFLAGS you want to configure including -DDEBUG in order
to activate support for debug messages in uShare.

Example :

CFLAGS="-Os -DDEBUG" ./configure --prefix=/usr
make

If you want to install uShare on your system, run :

make install-strip

This will copy the executable and manual page into their appropriate
directories (/usr/bin and /usr/man/man1 in this example).

For more information regarding configure and make, see the INSTALL document.

Usage
=====

uShare runs from the console only. It supports the usual --help option
which displays usage and option information.

Options :
-n :    Set UPnP Friendly Name (default is uShare)
-i :    Set Network Interface (default is eth0)
-c :    Set the content directory to be shared (default is ./)
-h :    Display this help

uShare expects a directory argument (-c argument), specifying where
multimedia files are stored. You should probably also use the -i option
to specify which interface uShare should listen on.

   ushare -c /shares

See the manual page for more details :

   man ushare

Supported File Formats List
===========================

- Video files : asf, avi, divx, wmv, mpeg, mpg, mpe, vob, m1v, m2v, m4v,
                ts, ogm, mkv, rmvb, mov, qt

- Audio files : mp2, mp3, mp4, mpa, ogg, wav, wma, mka, ra, rm, ram

- Images files : bmp, gif, jpeg, jpg, jpe, pcd, png, pnm, ppm

- Playlist files : pls, m3u, asx

If you want uShare to support more file formats, simply add its properties
in the src/mime.c table. Do not forget to send a patch to update uShare.

Feedback
========

The author of uShare and this document, Benjamin Zores, can be
contacted by e-mail on the following address:

   ben@geexbox.org

Please send bug reports, suggestions, ideas, comments or patches to :

   ushare@geexbox.org

Known bugs and limitations
==========================

If you need to listen on more than one interface, you will have to start
multiple instances of the media server.

uShare keeps some information on files in memory.
If your multimedia collection is huge, this might be a problem.

Thanks
======

Many thanks to Oskar Liljeblad for its original work on GMediaServer
(which is much more functionnal in terms of UPnP A/V features that
uShare will ever be).
