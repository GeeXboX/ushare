 GeeXboX uShare is a UPnP (TM) A/V Media Server. It implements the server
 component that provides UPnP media devices with information on available
 multimedia files. uShare uses the built-in http server of libupnp to stream
 the files to clients.
 .
 uShare is written in C for the GeeXboX project. It is designed to provide
 access to multimedia contents to GeeXboX but can of course be used by any
 other UPnP client device.
